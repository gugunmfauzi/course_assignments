## **Questions**  
1. **What is TCP/IP, and why is it important for computer networks?**  

TCP/IP stands for transmission control protocol/internet protocol which is a set of protocols that determine how data is transmitted and routed between network devices including the internet. TCP/IP is very important as it enables communication of various systems and provides the basis for us to interact with the web.


2. **What are the main functions of TCP in a network?**  

TCP has a primary function as a basic protocol that provides reliable, organized and error-checked data between applications in a network. It ensures data integrity and handles tasks such as flow control, error recovery and multiplexing.

3. **What role does IP play in a computer network?**  

In computer networks, IP is the foundation for identifying and transmitting data packets between devices. IP serves as the postal address for each device and ensures data is routed to its destination correctly.

4. **What is the difference between TCP and UDP, and when would you use each?**  

TCP is a connection-oriented, reliable protocol that guarantees the delivery of data sequentially and without damage. TCP is used when error checking and retransmission such as phone calls where connections are made. While UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless and unreliable protocol that focuses on speed and efficiency. UDP is like sending postcards where data is sent in individual packets without guaranteed delivery.

5. **What is the OSI model, and why is it important in networking?**  

The OSI model is a conceptual framework that divides network communication into seven layers where each layer has a specific function. The importance of this OSI Model in a network is because it provides a standardized and protocol agnostic way to understand and design networks so as to enable interoperability and communication between different systems and technologies.

6. **What is the first layer of the OSI model, and what is its function?**  

The first layer of the OSI Model is the physical layer. Its main function is to transmit raw data bits through physical media such as wired or wireless. This layer deals with the physical characteristics of the network such as voltage levels, cable types and connector pinouts.

7. **What does the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model do?**  

The transport layer (layer 4) in the OSI model is responsible for providing reliable and end-to-end data delivery between hosts. It manages network traffic and ensures that data arrives accurately in the correct order as well as handling flow control and errors. This layer uses TCP and UDP to accomplish these functions.

8. **What is the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model, and how does it work?**  

The network layer (Layer 3) in the OSI model is responsible for routing data packets between different networks. This layer handles addressing, packet fragmentation and reassembly and chooses the best path to take to reach its destination source. This is achieved through protocols such as IP and routing protocols.

9. **What is the role of the application layer (Layer 7) in the OSI model?**  

The Application Layer at layer 7 of the Osi Model acts as the interface between network applications and users, providing a direct interaction point for applications such as web browsers, email clients and file transfer protocols. This layer translates user or application data to a format that can be understood by lower layers for network communication essentially functioning as a network translator.

10. **How does understanding TCP/IP and the OSI model help in troubleshooting network issues?**  

Understanding the TCP/IP and OSI models helps in troubleshooting network problems by providing a structured framework to identify where problems may occur. These models break down network communication into layers, allowing systematic diagnosis and resolution of problems at a specific level.
