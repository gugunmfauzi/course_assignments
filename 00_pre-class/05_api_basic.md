## **Instructions**  
**Objective:** The goal of this exercise is to help you understand the concept of APIs, how they function in retrieving data, and their significance in web scraping tasks.

By the end of this exercise, you will gain the skills to utilize APIs effectively, learn the importance of reading documentation, and understand key terms like API keys, JSON, endpoints, and rate limits. ðŸš€

## **Questions**  
1. **What is an API, and how does it help get data from websites?**  

An API (Application Programing Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software programs to communicate and exchange data. In the context of getting data from websites, APIs provide a structured and efficient way to access information from a website or service rather than relying on web scraping which can be unreliable.

2. **Why do some websites offer APIs instead of letting people copy data directly?**  

APIs offer a structured, controlled and efficient way for developers to access and use data from websites rather than copying it directly. This approach provides several advantages over web scraping which involves manually parsing a site's HTML.

3. **What is an endpoint in an API?**  

The endpoint of an API is a specific location in the form of a URL, where the application programming interface (API) accepts requests for data or actions. This is the address that klein (other applications) use to interact with API resources and functionality. Think of it as the address where requests to get something from the API are sent.

4. **What is a GET request?**  

GET requests are simply a way for us to retrieve data from a data source with the help of the internet. This is done using the GET request method, which is a very common HTTP request method like POST, PUT or DELETE. Although the uppercase GET is not an acromine so it doesn't mean anything.

5. **What is an API key?**  

An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate and authorize access to the API. An API key works like a password that allows users to access its resources. API keys are critical to security because they allow API providers to manage access, track usage and prevent unauthorized access

6. **What is JSON?**  

JSOn stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is a lightweight format for storing and sending data and is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page. JSON is self-describing and easy to understand.

7. **What does "rate limit" mean?**  

A rate limit is a mechanism that controls the frequency or speed of requests that can be made to a system or network service. This mechanism sets a limit on the number of actions or requests that can be made within a certain period of time to prevent abuse and ensure fair use.

8. **What is Postman?**  

Postman is a popular API development and testing tool. It allows developers to design, build, test and collaborate on APIs and has millions of users and is used by hundreds of thousands of organizations around the world.

9. **Why is it important to read the documentation before using an API?**  

Reading the documentation before using an API is essential as it provides a comprehensive guide to understanding the functionality, usage and potential issues which ultimately saves development time and effort. The documentation explains how to integrate the API into the application as well as avoid errors and troubleshoot problems. It also helps in understanding the purpose, capabilities and limitations of APIs such as rates.

10. **What are query parameters?**  

Query parameters also known as query strings are key-value pads added to the URL after the question mark (?). This parameter provides additional information to the web server that allows it to customize content or actions based on the submitted data. Basically this parameter is like a URL extension that allows to define certain actions or content based on the transmitted data.
